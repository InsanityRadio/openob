<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>OpenOB is an audio over IP (AoIP) transciever tool that can manage establishment and recovery of AoIP links in a low overhead manner.</p>
<p>It supports lossless linear PCM audio as well as the Opus audio codec for compressed audio operation. It is designed to operate as a standalone tool, but is also straightforward to use in your own projects, such as for building AoIP hardware.</p>
<div class="section" id="architecture">
<h2>Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenOB is a peer to peer audio streaming system with a central configuration server.</p>
<p>The program itself is a set of Python classes wrapping the PyGST bindings for the GStreamer media framework, which itself performs the audio encoding/decoding and transmission.</p>
<p>An OpenOB <em>link</em> is comprised of a receiver and transmitter pair.</p>
<p>All OpenOB transmitters and receivers communicate configuration data by way of a <em>configuration server</em>.</p>
<p>The audio is sent directly between transmitter and receiver using the Real Time Protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="audio-quality">
<h2>Audio Quality<a class="headerlink" href="#audio-quality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenOB in linear PCM mode with appropriate sound cards is measurably transparent, over any network (assuming properly configured jitter buffer and sufficient bandwidth).</p>
<p>In Opus mode, OpenOB performs as well as the codec permits, which in the case of Opus is very well - at higher bitrates it is generally accepted to be equivalent in quality to higher-bitrate AAC and MP3 (ie 96k Opus beats 128k MP3). At lower bitrates, it also performs well, beating out codecs like G.722 for speech content.</p>
<p>The main limiting factors to quality are the sound cards used in the computers used by OpenOB, and available bitrate.</p>
<p>For most entry-level broadcast purposes, sufficiently well-engineered integrated audio cards may be sufficient for users. However, for professional use, the use of a professional sound card is typically required. OpenOB plays well with ALSA and JACK as well as other GStreamer supported audio sources, giving you excellent out of the box compatibility with a wide range of professional audio cards.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">Sound Cards</p>
<p>OpenOB works with any ALSA supported device, and can also make use of the JACK audio server to make use of more complex routing configurations.</p>
<p>Any card that supports ALSA or can be used via JACK&#8217;s firewire modules can be used, in other words.</p>
<p>Tested cards include:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Behringer UCA202</li>
<li>ART USB Dual Tube</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-requirements">
<h2>System Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#system-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenOB is relatively lightweight and will run on many systems; the requirement for near-real-time audio does impose more restrictions than mere CPU and RAM requirements.</p>
<p>The following is a recommended set of specifications that are known to run OpenOB and handle external sound cards without issue.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dual-core Intel Atom, i3 or better &#64; 1.2GHz or better</li>
<li>512MB RAM (2GB if you want a desktop environment)</li>
<li>100Mbps NIC</li>
<li>Debian Wheezy (7.0)</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenOB has been known to run on systems with significantly lower specifications.</p>
<div class="section" id="embedded-systems">
<h3>Embedded Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#embedded-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many embedded platforms, typically using ARM processors, offer a low cost Linux environment. Due to various issues around bus speeds, clock stability and CPU capability not all such platforms will work without audio discontinuities.</p>
<p>Platforms that are known to work without flaws are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Raspberry Pi with Wolfson Audio board</li>
<li>Beagleboard xM with USB audio codec</li>
</ul>
<p>Other platforms that are known not to work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Beagleboard Black with USB audio codec (clicks)</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi with USB audio codec (clicks, massive discontinuities above 32kHz sample rate)</li>
<li>Olimex A10 Linux boards (clicks)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="network">
<h3>Network<a class="headerlink" href="#network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OpenOB offers a variety of modes that allow for low-bitrate operation for speech only links, and medium to high bitrate full bandwidth links for musical content. The <a class="reference internal" href="configuration.html#bitrates-and-bandwidths"><em>Bitrates and Bandwidths</em></a> section of the manual discusses these recommendations in detail.</p>
<p>In general your network must support more than 50 kilobytes per second with near-zero loss. You will need to be able to open ports on the firewall at the receiver side; transmitters can emit audio from behind NAT gateways and most permissive egress firewalls.</p>
<p>If a tunnel is required eg to bypass a firewall, a VPN operating with a UDP wrapper is recommended. TCP tunneling such as SSH will result in seriously degraded links, and is not recommended.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>When determining your network requirements, budget for at least 10kbps overhead to allow OpenOB itself room to communicate configuration data.</p>
<p class="last">Also bear in mind that framing sizes and error correction will add overhead to the basic audio bitstream itself.</p>
